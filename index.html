    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        I have lived internationally most of my life, born in Mexico, from there I lived in Argentina, The United States in Arkansas, China, Thailand, Peru, and from there I served a Mission 
        in Japan. I enjoy sports such as basketball, outdoor actives like mountain biking, hiking, and swimming, and on rainy days I enjoy tv, video games, and board games with friends. 
        I have a deep love for traveling and learning new cultures and adding favorite foods to an ever-growing list. I am looking forward to getting to future opportunities!
